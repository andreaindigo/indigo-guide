# Our Customer Success Team

At indigo.ai, our **Customer Success Team is your dedicated partner** throughout every stage of your AI journey—helping you get the most out of your virtual assistant, from day one and well beyond.

## 🚀 Initial Configuration & Launch

During the **onboarding phase** (also known as the “**build**” phase), we’ll work closely with you to **design, configure, and launch your virtual assistant**.\
From structuring your first conversation flows to integrating with your systems and testing everything before go-live—we’re here to guide you every step of the way.

## 📊 Recurrent Performance Reviews

We’ll organize **regular performance reviews** (at least once per year) to:

* Analyze your assistant’s real-world performance
* Gather insights from user conversations
* Identify new opportunities for optimization and expansion

This continuous feedback loop ensures your virtual assistant stays aligned with your business goals and keeps delivering real value.

## 🔧 Ongoing Support

If your contract includes **ongoing support**, we’ll continue to work alongside you to **improve, evolve, and scale your AI assistant** over time. We’re here to assist with:

* Creating or editing conversational workflows
* Reviewing AI agent responses and optimizing performance
* Supporting integrations with your systems (e.g., CRMs, APIs) and channels (e.g., Web Chat, Voice, WhatsApp)
* Handling commercial requests, like activating new channels
* Migrating your assistant from an older version of the platform features to the latest ones

We aim to provide a **first response** within **24 hours**.
