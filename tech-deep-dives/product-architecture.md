# Product Architecture

## System Architecture Overview

At indigo.ai, we‚Äôve designed a robust, secure, and scalable architecture to support the full lifecycle of your AI Agents‚Äîfrom user interaction to AI processing and response delivery. Our architecture enables seamless data flows, real-time processing, and reliable integrations with Large Language Models (LLMs) and third-party systems.

The indigo.ai technology stack leverages cutting-edge **machine learning models** and **LLMs** to understand and generate natural language. This technology is made easily accessible in the form of a **virtual assistant that can be installed on phone systems, web pages, messaging platforms, and apps, or accessed via API**. Regardless of where the conversation takes place, indigo.ai can manage it seamlessly on both **desktop and mobile**.

The diagram below illustrates the high-level architecture, **hosted primarily on IBM Cloud (Frankfurt)**, and how the platform components interact to process user requests in real time.

## üß© Services, Applications, and Technical Components

At the core of the indigo.ai solution is a **cloud-based SaaS platform hosted in the IBM Cloud** (**Frankfurt** region). The platform is composed of:

* **Frontend**: A web-based administrative interface built using a **React microfrontend architecture**.
* **Backend**: Developed in **Elixir**, it exposes **GraphQL APIs** for internal and third-party integrations.

#### Data Management

For **data storage**, the platform relies on:

* **PostgreSQL 16**, managed via **Neon‚Äôs serverless service** (hosted in the AWS Frankfurt region), which handles most of the application data.
* **S3-compatible object storage**, also hosted on IBM Cloud, to **store user-uploaded documents and files**.

#### AI Processing

**Advanced AI services** are delivered by a proprietary application also hosted on **IBM Cloud**. This service includes:

* A **Redis-based volatile cache**, used for real-time processing and temporary storage to ensure fast response times.
* Interfaces with top-tier [**Large Language Models (LLMs)**](../getting-started/ai-knowledge-hub/large-language-models-llms-available-on-our-platform.md) (e.g., GPT, Claude, Mistral) hosted in **EU-based data centers**, ensuring full **GDPR compliance** and alignment with current data protection regulations.

#### Secrets Management

Infrastructure and application secrets are managed securely through IBM‚Äôs dedicated **Secrets Manager**, which is based on **HashiCorp Vault** technology. This ensures a high level of protection for sensitive credentials and configurations.

#### Web Widget

For end-user interactions, we provide a highly optimized **web widget**, consisting of two JavaScript applications (one native, one built with **Preact**). The widget is designed to be lightweight and performance-friendly, minimizing the impact on hosting websites.&#x20;

All widget assets are served directly from the platform‚Äôs backend and communicate with it via a secure **WebSocket (WSS)** channel.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Specifications

### Communication Interfaces

The primary communication channel is **web-based** and secured via **TLS 1.3**, using a set of strong and up-to-date security protocols. Within the platform:

* The **frontend and backend** communicate through:
  * A **GraphQL API** over HTTPS
  * A secure **WebSocket (WSS)** channel
* Communication with **internal services**‚Äîsuch as AI services, Object Storage, and the Secrets Manager‚Äîoccurs over **private HTTPS connections**.
* All interactions with **external APIs and third-party services** are performed via **encrypted HTTPS channels**.
* Backend-to-database communication is handled over **native TCP**, encrypted with **TLS 1.2** for secure data transmission.
* The connection between the **backend and the web widget** also uses **encrypted WebSocket (WSS)** connections, secured with **TLS 1.3**.

### Component Dependencies

The core platform service is responsible for the majority of system functionality and has a **primary dependency on the PostgreSQL database** for data storage and persistence.

Other components play supporting roles and are used for specific capabilities:

* **AI services**, **Object Storage**, and the **Secrets Manager** enhance the platform‚Äôs intelligence, scalability, and security‚Äîbut are considered **optional** from a functional standpoint.
* The **AI service** specifically relies on a **Redis database** used as a volatile cache, enabling fast processing and temporary storage of computational results.

## üîê Data Security

### Protection Against Unauthorized Access and Data Loss

All infrastructure and services used by indigo.ai are protected with strong credentials, managed securely via **1Password**. Administrative passwords are shared only with essential personnel and always through secure channels.

For **critical systems,** such as core infrastructure, access is strictly monitored. Any action performed using administrative credentials is logged and tracked. Third-party access is granted **only when strictly necessary** and is subject to the same **monitoring and logging policies** applied to internal users.

Access is **segmented by role**, ensuring that each user (internal or external) can interact only with the specific systems and services necessary to perform their tasks. This is especially enforced for systems handling sensitive or critical data.

Operational users are assigned **personalized accounts**, subject to the same security policies as system-level users.

Access reviews are conducted **quarterly** across all systems. Any anomalies identified during these reviews are addressed promptly.

Our **PostgreSQL database** is backed up **daily**, with a **30-day retention policy**. Backup integrity is periodically tested to ensure data can be recovered if needed.

### Encryption and Threat Protection

The platform integrates **real-time security monitoring and threat detection** to safeguard against potential breaches.

All platform code undergoes **continuous static analysis** to identify vulnerabilities early in the development process. This also applies to our **Docker images**, which package the application code and are scanned for known security risks.

All communication between platform components is encrypted using **TLS**, preferably version **1.3** (with **1.2** as the minimum supported). Only the most secure cipher suites are used, in line with **OWASP recommendations**.

The **database features encryption at rest**, with keys managed automatically for optimal security.

### Data Privacy Rules

**All data processed by our AI Agents is stored and managed entirely within our platform.**&#x20;

**Full user messages remain confined to our internal systems.**

In some cases, third-party services may be used to process data or integrate with external platforms. In these situations, the following strict rules are applied:

* Data is **never shared across agents**.
* Data is **never stored by third-party services**: it is used and immediately discarded.
* Data is **never used to train or improve models outside the configured assistant**.
* Data is **never sent to an external service unless explicitly specified** in the assistant‚Äôs configuration.

## üë• Authentication and Authorization

### User Roles and Permissions

The indigo.ai platform includes a robust **user profiling system** that controls access to platform features and sensitive information based on assigned roles.

We support multiple user roles, each with specific permissions:

* **Owner**: Full administrative access, including user management, configuration of the Knowledge Base, and control over all platform features.
* **Admin**: Access to manage platform features and edit or configure the Knowledge Base.
* **Editor**: Limited to viewing **Analytics** and the **Knowledge Base** only.

Permissions can be configured at a **granular level**, granting or revoking access for specific users or roles.&#x20;

The platform includes a built-in **user management interface** that allows you to:

* Invite new users
* Assign or update roles
* Remove user access as needed

This ensures that only authorized personnel can make changes or access critical components‚Äîenhancing both security and governance.
