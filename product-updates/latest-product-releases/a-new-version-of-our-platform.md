## A Revolution in AI Agent Creation

The most significant change in this new version of the platform is the separation between **agents** and **workflows**. We’ve made it easier to create both components, allowing for faster setup and more streamlined management.

### Agents vs. Workflows

* **Agents**: These are the core components of your AI system, functioning as subject matter experts. Each agent is specialized in handling specific interactions, whether it’s answering FAQs, providing customer support, or offering product recommendations. \
  With the new version, **creating agents has never been easier or more flexible**. Simply click a button, set a trigger to define when the agent should activate, and the agent will respond with minimal configuration. This streamlined process makes agent creation faster and more intuitive.
* **Workflows**: While agents handle specialized tasks, workflows manage more **complex, step-by-step processes**. Workflows are perfect for scenarios where a sequence of actions is required before delivering a response, such as checking inventory or connecting with customer support. They’re incredibly flexible and can be built using an intuitive **drag-and-drop interface**, making it easy to integrate workflows into your virtual assistant without needing advanced coding skills.

#### The Mother Agent: The Brain Behind the Scenes

At the heart of this new system is the Mother Agent, an unseen **orchestrator** that **ensures every query is handled by the most suitable agent or workflow**. When a user sends a message, the Mother Agent assesses the context and dynamically directs the conversation to the best possible response.&#x20;

The Mother Agent uses **triggers**—conditions set to define when an agent or workflow should be activated—to ensure efficient and seamless conversation flow. This new system makes the process highly adaptable to varying user queries, improving overall performance.

## A More User-Friendly and Flexible Platform

The new version of our platform is more user-friendly than ever, thanks to a complete redesign. We’ve refined the look and feel to deliver a sleek, intuitive experience, making it easier to navigate and manage your workspace.&#x20;

This revamped design lays the foundation for the continuous release of powerful new features like **debugging**, the **new mail block**, **file upload capabilities**, and the possibility to **copy-paste blocks**, all designed to streamline your workflows and boost your productivity. \

Additionally, the new platform hosts the **completely revamped Web Chat**—a reimagining of the chat interface. What was once a simple conversation box has now evolved into a feature-rich widget with an intuitive homepage, vibrant visuals, and extensive customization options, allowing you to create a chat experience that aligns perfectly with your brand. \
