# Voice gets smarter: new Hang up and Transfer Call Blocks

The indigo.ai voice channel keeps evolving, and itâ€™s now even more powerful thanks to two new Action Blocks designed to enhance both user experience and call management.

### Hangup Block

With this block, you can end the call exactly when needed and immediately trigger follow-up actions.

* Example use case: at the end of the conversation, automatically send a summary email, save the transcript in your CRM, or call an API to update internal systems.

This way, the call doesnâ€™t just end: it becomes the starting point for valuable automated processes.

{% endhint %}

### Transfer Call Block

The Transfer Call Block lets you redirect a call to an external number while keeping the user experience under control.

ðŸ‘‰ You can:

* play a custom waiting message to let the user know whatâ€™s happening,
* provide music on hold while the call is being transferred,
* set availability time slots, so users arenâ€™t left waiting when the service is offline,
* manage errors or unavailability with ready-made fallback routes.

With these two new blocks, the Voice channel becomes even more performant, flexible, and aligned with your customersâ€™ needsâ€”from customer support to internal business processes.
