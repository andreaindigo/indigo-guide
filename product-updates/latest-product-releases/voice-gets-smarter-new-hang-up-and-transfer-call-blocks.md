# Voice gets smarter: new Hang up and Transfer Call Blocks

The indigo.ai voice channel keeps evolving, and it’s now even more powerful thanks to two new Action Blocks designed to enhance both user experience and call management.

### Hangup Block

With this block, you can end the call exactly when needed and immediately trigger follow-up actions.

* Example use case: at the end of the conversation, automatically send a summary email, save the transcript in your CRM, or call an API to update internal systems.

This way, the call doesn’t just end: it becomes the starting point for valuable automated processes.

{% endhint %}

### Transfer Call Block

The Transfer Call Block lets you redirect a call to an external number while keeping the user experience under control.

👉 You can:

* play a custom waiting message to let the user know what’s happening,
* provide music on hold while the call is being transferred,
* set availability time slots, so users aren’t left waiting when the service is offline,
* manage errors or unavailability with ready-made fallback routes.
