# New Utilities: Conversation Logs & Evaluators

## Conversation Logs

### 📌 Overview

Conversation Logs provide a centralized place in the Indigo.ai platform where you can view the full list of chatbot conversations and their corresponding Evaluator results.\
This section allows teams to analyze every single conversation, understand how evaluators and guardrails performed, and start any necessary debugging flows.

### ✅ Benefits

* Detailed visibility → review all conversations in one place, with full evaluator and guardrail outcomes.
* Operational efficiency → quickly identify issues, user feedback, or API errors without switching tools.
* Debug-ready → inspect conversations in detail, including errors and triggers, to improve the chatbot’s performance.

### 💬 What is a Conversation Log?

A Conversation Log represents one interaction between a chatbot and an end-user.

* A conversation begins when the user starts the chat and ends when they click Close Chat.
* Multiple conversations together form a chat.

In the Conversation Logs view, you can browse the list of conversations and check how evaluators and guardrails performed for each one.

## Evaluators & Guardrails

### 📌 Overview

Evaluators (or evals) are automated tools in Indigo.ai that analyze and assess chatbot–user conversations.\
They help measure key aspects such as response relevance, dialogue coherence, tone, and topics, providing objective, timely, and scalable evaluations without relying on manual reviews.

Evaluators work together with Guardrails, which act as preventive checks during live conversations. Together, they provide a complete framework for monitoring, improving, and governing chatbot quality.

### ✅ Benefits

* Objective and fast evaluations → continuous quality monitoring, independent from human judgment.
* Operational efficiency → reduce manual effort, freeing resources for higher-value tasks.
* Trend and pattern detection → uncover recurring issues, user sentiment trends, or escalation needs.
* Improved perceived quality → proactive monitoring strengthens brand reputation and service trustworthiness.

### Built-in vs Custom

indigo.ai provides both built-in evaluators and guardrails (ready-to-use “black boxes”), and the ability to design custom ones for specific use cases.
