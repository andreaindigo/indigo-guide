# Voice in Web Chat: More Accessible Conversations

## **A more natural, inclusive way to engage with your virtual assistant**

We’ve just added **native voice capabilities to the indigo.ai web chat widget**, making conversations more human-like, accessible, and intuitive than ever.&#x20;

**Users can now listen to messages or speak instead of typing**, all directly within the widget.

Voice has long been available as a [dedicated channel](../../getting-started/communication-channels/voice.md) (for phone-based virtual assistants), and now it’s available in your web chat too.

This update unlocks a powerful layer of **accessibility and usability**: users with visual impairments, reading difficulties, or limited mobility, as well as those simply on the go, can now engage with your AI Agent using their voice.

## 🎙️ Speak Instead of Typing

Users can now **record a voice message right from the typebar in normal chat mode**. Instead of sending the audio directly, the system **transcribes the message and places the resulting text in the typebar, ready for editing or immediate sending**.

This makes it easier and faster to communicate, especially for users who prefer speaking over typing, or those using mobile devices.

## 🎧 Listen to the Bot’s Messages

Users can now listen to any message from the virtual assistant with a single tap. A dedicated speaker icon appears next to every message: when clicked, it **reads the virtual assistants' message aloud using the selected voice and provider** (e.g., ElevenLabs).&#x20;

* A quick loading indicator appears before the playback starts
* Users can pause or stop playback at any time
* The voice used can be customized in the platform settings

This makes content more accessible and creates a more natural interaction flow, especially in mobile and multitasking environments.

## 📞 Call Mode (Coming Soon)

We are working on a feature that will allow users to start a real-time **voice call with your AI Agent**, right from the web chat. With this feature, the chat transforms into a fully voice-based experience.

This will open up an entirely new way for customers to engage, especially for use cases like support, onboarding, or conversational services.

### 🔧 How to Enable

You can activate both **message listening** and **voice input** directly from your workspace settings under:\
[**Settings → Web Chat → Voice**](../../build-your-ai-agents/configure-and-install-the-web-chat.md#voice).

You can:

* Choose a voice provider (e.g., ElevenLabs)
* Select a preferred voice
* Enable listening and/or voice input modes.&#x20;

These new voice features are now available to all workspaces. No special API or configuration required: just activate them in your widget settings.
