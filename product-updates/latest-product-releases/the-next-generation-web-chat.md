# The Next-Generation Web Chat

We‚Äôre excited to release a fresh update to our web chat, transforming every customer interaction into a dynamic and engaging experience.&#x20;

We've **completely reimagined our web chat** from a simple conversation box into a **feature-rich widget with an intuitive homepage, vibrant visuals, and extensive customization options**‚Äîempowering you to craft a chat experience that perfectly aligns with your brand.

This upgrade is designed to make every customer interaction not only functional, but also delightful and engaging‚Äîhelping users quickly understand what they can ask while encouraging deeper interaction. ‚ú®

## What‚Äôs New

This latest update introduces three exciting features designed to elevate your web chat experience:

1. **Pre-chat Engagement**: The revamped chat launcher button and pop-up message now capture visitors' attention before they even start a conversation.
2. **Fresh Homepage Concept**: Upon clicking the launcher button, users are greeted with a redesigned homepage that highlights your web chat‚Äôs capabilities in a stylish and engaging way. The homepage  supports **clickable images**‚Äîeach image can optionally link to a conversation flow or external page, giving you even more control over how users interact with your assistant right from the start.
3. **Flexible Conversation Start**: You now have the flexibility to decide whether visitors see the homepage first or jump straight into a conversation with a fully customized assistant that reflects your brand identity.
4. **Session Persistence**: The new widget now **keeps the user session active by default**. If the session is still active and the conversation hasn‚Äôt been closed (e.g., after page reloads, navigation, or when switching apps on mobile), previous messages are restored. By default, the session lasts **for 10 minutes**, after which a button appears to start a new chat.&#x20;
