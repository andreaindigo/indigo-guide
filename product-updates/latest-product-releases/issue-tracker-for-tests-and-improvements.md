# Issue Tracker for Tests & Improvements

## A Built-In Quality Assurance Dashboard

We‚Äôre excited to announce a major enhancement to the indigo.ai platform: Issue Tracker, a centralized dashboard for **managing, tracking, and resolving improvement points during the testing and optimization phase of your virtual assistants**.

Until now, this process was handled externally through spreadsheets and ad-hoc mechanisms like responses thumbs-up/down ratings. With this release, all feedback and issue tracking is now seamlessly integrated into the platform, from problem or improvement identification to resolution.

This new feature simplifies collaboration among everyone involved in managing the virtual assistant, whether it's colleagues across departments or you and our Customer Success team. It also enhances transparency, bringing structure, visibility, and speed to your assistant improvement workflows.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Issue Tracker is currently available as a **beta feature** for selected indigo.ai clients and partners.

To request access or activate this feature for your workspace, please reach out directly to our [Customer Success Team](../../need-help/our-customer-success-team.md).
{% endhint %}

### Business Impact

The new Issue Tracker helps you:

‚úÖ **Streamline QA**: Eliminate disorganized feedback and manual tracking.\
‚úÖ **Accelerate Time-to-Fix**: See the full issue history and debugging data in one click.\
‚úÖ **Enhance Collaboration**: Keep internal teams and indigo.ai aligned throughout the improvement cycle.\
‚úÖ **Showcase Quality Assurance**: Make your testing process more transparent and valuable during implementation and rollout.

## üö© What is an Issue?

An "issue" is **any interaction that doesn‚Äôt meet expectations**. Examples include:

* Incorrect or ambiguous responses
* A tone that doesn‚Äôt reflect your brand
* Inappropriate or prohibited content

Whether you're in a pre-production testing phase or monitoring live conversations, the Issue Tracker ensures nothing slips through the cracks.

## Key Features

### üìå Centralized [Dashboard](../../getting-started/workspace-sections/utilities/issue-tracker.md)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/issues.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Manage all feedback from one place:

* Search and filter by issue ID, date, assignee, tags, priority, or status
* Add multiple filters and group issues by tag, priority, assignee, or state
* Sort issues and navigate through them using an intuitive paginated interface
* Perform bulk updates with checkbox selection

The dashboard also shows at-a-glance counters for each issue state, helping you track progress at a glance.

### üìù Easy Issue Creation

Create issues directly from multiple areas of the platform:

* [**Chats Section**](../../getting-started/workspace-sections/chats/#issue-creation): Hover over any message to flag it, triggering a right-side panel where you can add the issue title, description, priority, tag, and assignee.

* [**Issue Tracker Page**](../../getting-started/workspace-sections/utilities/issue-tracker.md): Click the "+ Create Issue" button to log feedback not tied to a specific interaction.

Each issue includes:

* A unique ID and timestamp
* Title and detailed description
* Customizable tags describing the issue (e.g., Bug, Improvement, API Error, Bad Tone of Voice, etc.)
* Assignee (by default, your indigo.ai Customer Success Manager)
* Status (To Do, In Progress, Done, Review)
* Priority level (Low, Medium, Urgent)
* Number of comments and last edited timestamp

## How It Works

1. **Spot an Issue**: Flag a message from the Chats page or from the chat Preview.
2. **Log and categorize**: Provide a title, tag, description, assign ownership, and set a priority.
3. **Track progress**: Use filters, comments, and status updates in the Issue Tracker to follow progress through to resolution.
