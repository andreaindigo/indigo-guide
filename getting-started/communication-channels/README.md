# Communication Channels

indigo.ai virtual assistants can be deployed across a wide range of communication channels, allowing you to **meet your users where they are**—whether that’s on your **website**, in **messaging apps**, within **CRM systems**, or through **voice**-based interactions. Our platform gives you the flexibility to choose the channels that best support your business goals and customer needs.

## **Available Communication Channels**

1. 🌐 [**Web Chat**](web-chat.md)\
   Easily deploy your assistant on your website or app using our fully customizable Web Chat widget. Designed for an intuitive, branded experience, it supports rich interactions and advanced configurations.
2. **💼** [**Web Chat Integration within CRM Platforms**](web-chat-integration-within-crm-platforms.md)\
   Integrate your assistant into the web chat tools of CRM platforms like Zendesk or Salesforce. This allows it to function directly within your existing support ecosystem—streamlining interactions and ensuring smooth handovers between automated and human support.
3. **📱** [**WhatsApp**](whatsapp.md)\
   Provide fast, mobile-friendly support through WhatsApp.
4. 🗣️ [**Voice**](voice.md)\
   Offer voice-based interactions through Voice support. Whether over the phone or, in the future, directly in web chat, this channel allows users to engage with your assistant using speech for a more natural and accessible experience.

### Analytics for Each Channel

If your assistant operates across multiple channels, you'll soon be able to track and analyze performance for each one separately. This feature—planned for release in the coming months—will provide channel-specific analytics to help you measure effectiveness on each platform and optimize the user experience accordingly.
