# Web Chat

Our Web Chat allows you to **deploy your virtual assistant directly on your website or app.**&#x20;

It’s more than just a simple chat box—it's a **feature-rich widget** designed to enhance user interaction with vibrant visuals and **extensive customization options**.&#x20;

The Web Chat offers:

* **Pre-chat Engagement**: The revamped chat launcher button and pop-up message now capture visitors' attention before they even start a conversation.
* **Fresh Homepage Concept**: Upon clicking the launcher button, users are greeted with a redesigned homepage that highlights your web chat’s capabilities in a stylish and engaging way. The homepage  supports **clickable images**—each image can optionally link to a conversation flow or external page, giving you even more control over how users interact with your assistant right from the start.
* **Flexible Conversation Start**: You now have the flexibility to decide whether visitors see the homepage first or jump straight into a conversation with a fully customized assistant that reflects your brand identity.
* **Session Persistence**: The new widget now **keeps the user session active by default**. If the session is still active and the conversation hasn’t been closed (e.g., after page reloads, navigation, or when switching apps on mobile), previous messages are restored. By default, the session lasts **for 10 minutes**, after which a button appears to start a new chat.&#x20;

### 2. A Smart Homepage for Your Chatbot

The new chat window is more than just a place for conversations—it's a dynamic landing page that showcases your assistant’s capabilities. When users first access your web chat, they are welcomed with a fully customizable homepage that explains what the assistant can do and guides them on how to get started.

**Key Features:**&#x20;

* **Welcome message** 👋\
  Set the tone with a friendly headline.&#x20;
* **Brief Explanation**\
  Provide a concise overview of the topics your assistant can handle.&#x20;
* **Grid of Images**\
  Display popular or frequently searched topics in an image grid. Each image can be made **clickable**, allowing you to assign specific actions:
  * Trigger a bot response or workflow.
  * Redirect to an external link in a new browser tab.
* **Typebar**\
  Enable the typebar at startup and customize its placeholder message.
* **Example Questions**❓\
  Include up to five clickable questions that lead to immediate answers.&#x20;
* **AI Animation** \
  Add an engaging animation above the welcome message, customizable to match your brand’s colors.

Together, these elements create a structured and intuitive experience, helping users find the information they need quickly and easily—without feeling lost.

### 3. Chat Launch & Assistant Identity

With this update, you’re in full control of how conversations start and how your assistant is presented.

* **Decide How the Conversation Begins**\
  Choose whether users will first see the customizable homepage or go directly into conversation mode when they click the web chat launcher button.
* **Assistant identity**\
  Beyond previous features like background color customization for responses, you now have more styling options. You can assign a name to your assistant and select an avatar icon that appears alongside its name and every response.
