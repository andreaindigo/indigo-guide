# WhatsApp

WhatsApp is a great choice for **providing immediate support** to your users. As one of the most widely used messaging platforms globally, WhatsApp makes it easy to engage with your audience and offer on-the-go assistance.&#x20;

#### Key Features and Considerations for WhatsApp Integration

* **Customization Limitations**:
  * You cannot modify the appearance of buttons, including size, color, or icons.
  * Carousels (image sliders) are supported for interactive content.
  * There is no visual indicator (e.g., typing dots) when the assistant is preparing a response.
  * The typebar cannot be disabled when using [quick replies](../blocks/action-blocks/quick-reply-block.md), so users may type their responses instead of clicking the buttons.
  * Button text has a limit of 20 characters, with a maximum of 3 buttons supported per message.
  * Links must be written out in full as WhatsApp doesn’t support hyperlinks.
  * Captions cannot be used for buttons or images.
* **Architecture**:\
  All WhatsApp messages are processed internally by the platform, just like messages from the web chat widget. In terms of data storage, WhatsApp (Meta) and our channel provider may store data according to their respective policies.

#### What You Need to Activate Your Virtual Assistant on WhatsApp

1. A phone number.
2. A WhatsApp Smart Business Account.
3. A Meta Business Account.
4. The phone number must be registered with Meta and associated with the WhatsApp Smart Business Account.

#### Case Study: Flou's Use of WhatsApp for Retailer Support

Flou, a furniture company with a global network of over 1,000 retailers, wanted to improve communication with its distributors. With limited direct-to-consumer sales, they opted to use a virtual assistant on WhatsApp to provide constant support to their retailers.

A typical use case: A retailer in a physical store can quickly ask the Whatsapp virtual assistant for information without needing to refer to an outdated annual catalog.&#x20;
