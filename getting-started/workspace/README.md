# Workspace

## Workspace overview

A workspace is the main operational area where you manage and monitor your virtual assistants. It consists of a left-side navigation menu and a central content area. The content area updates dynamically based on the menu section you select.

When you access a workspace, you are taken to the Home section by default.
