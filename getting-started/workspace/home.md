# Home

**The Home section is the landing page of each workspace.**\
It displays a snapshot of your agents’ activity through three key metrics, shown in dedicated boxes:

* **Users**: the number of users interacting with your agents
* **Chats**: the total number of chat sessions initiated
* **Messages**: the total number of messages handled by your virtual assistants

The reference date for these metrics is clearly displayed at the top of the page (for example: _“Here’s what’s happening today — Feb 2”_).
