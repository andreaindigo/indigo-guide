# Team settings

The Team settings section allows you to centrally and easily manage workspace members, roles, and related permissions.

From here, you can invite new users, assign and edit roles, customize permissions, and create custom roles based on your team’s needs.\
The role–permission matrix provides **granular access control**, enabling collaboration among multiple users while ensuring **security, privacy, and operational consistency**.

### Team settings features

The Team settings page includes all the features needed to manage workspace members and their roles.\
The page is organized into three main areas:

1. **Invite members**   \
   The Invite members feature allows you to invite new users to the workspace and represents the main entry point for adding new team members.
2. **Roles**   \
   The Roles button provides access to the section dedicated to managing roles and their associated permissions.   \
   From here, users with the Owner or Admin role can view and customize workspace roles.
3.  **Workspace members**    \
    At the bottom of the page, a table displays all members currently associated with the workspace.    \
    For each member, the following information is shown:    \
    \- Name    \
    \- Email    \
    \- Status    \
    \- Role

    The Role field is managed through a dropdown menu, allowing you to quickly change a user’s role without navigating to additional screens.

#### Who can manage Team settings

Only users with the **Owner or Admin** role can:\
\- manage roles;\
\- create new custom roles;\
\- modify role permissions.

### System roles

The platform includes the following system roles, ordered by a decreasing level of access and responsibility, from Owner to Viewer:\
**Owner** – full access and total control over the workspace\
**Admin** – operational management of the workspace and roles\
**Editor** – editing content and permitted configurations\
**Manager** – coordination of activities and the team\
**Operator** – operational use of assigned features\
**Viewer** – view-only access

Permissions decrease progressively from Owner to Viewer.<br>

This structure allows you to:\
\- ensure greater security and privacy by limiting access to only what is necessary;\
\- reduce the risk of accidental or unauthorized changes;\
\- enable many users to collaborate on the same workspace, each with the most appropriate access level.

Thanks to permission customization, the role hierarchy strikes a balance between **control and collaboration**, adapting to teams of any size.

### Roles section

The Roles section is visible only to **Admin and Owner** users and allows you to manage workspace roles and permissions.\
By default, the first role displayed is **Admin**, as it is responsible for the operational management of the workspace, together with the Owner who created it.

From this screen, you can perform three main actions:

1. **view** the permissions associated with each role;
2. **edit** an existing role;
3. **create** a new custom role.

#### View and edit a role

To view or edit a role:

1. use the dropdown menu to select the desired role;
2. once selected, the associated permissions are displayed;
3. if needed, enter edit mode to enable or disable permissions.

#### Create a new role

To create a custom role:

1. click New role;
2. the new role will always start from the Viewer default permissions, the lowest access level;
3. add or remove permissions to define the role;
4. assign a name to the role and save your changes.

This approach allows you to create tailored roles while maintaining a **high level of control, security, and consistency** within the workspace.
