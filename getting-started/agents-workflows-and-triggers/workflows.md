# Workflows



## ⛓️ Workflows

Workflows represent a **step-by-step process that must be completed before an agent responds or the virtual assistant takes action**.

While it's mandatory to configure at least one agent, workflows are **optional** and can be implemented as needed. For simple setups, you can build a virtual assistant composed solely of agents.&#x20;

However, for more complex scenarios, workflows become essential. For example:&#x20;

* **Product Recommendation** Workflow: User requests the best product → virtual assistant retrieves and filters options from the catalog → best-fit product is passed to the agent → agent shares the recommendation.
* **Customer Support** Workflow: User asks to connect with a human → workflow gathers conversation history and user details → virtual assistant connects with the CRM → support ticket is created and confirmed to the user.

Workflows are the backbone of complex virtual assistants, but building them is simple. In your workspace, you can just **drag and drop** workflow components from the available **blocks**. This approach makes workflow creation highly intuitive and flexible.
