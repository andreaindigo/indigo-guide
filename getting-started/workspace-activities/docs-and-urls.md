# Docs & URLs

In this section, you can upload documents and add links to enrich your knowledge base. The system will use the content from your uploaded files and URLs to provide more accurate and informed responses.

#### 📄 Uploading Documents

To upload a document:

1. Click the Upload Documents button.
2. Select the file from your device.

Supported formats: .pdf, .docx, .txt, .csv, .xlsx

⚠️ Password-protected files are not supported.

#### 🔗 Adding URLs

Once uploaded, you can **assign a Tag** to each document or URL.

Tags allow you to easily reference specific content later, for example when configuring your Agent.

#### 🏷️ Using Tags

The more you upload individual documents with specific tags, the better your Agent will be able to retrieve the right information from each file.

#### ♻️ Managing Your Content

You can:

* Replace an existing document with an updated version.
* Delete documents or URLs that are no longer needed.
* Refresh linked web pages to update the content used by your Agent.<br>

💡 If you make changes to a linked webpage, remember to click Refresh to ensure your Agent uses the latest version.

#### 🧩 Examples

**Example 1 – Document**

* Document: Product\_Manual.pdf – contains detailed descriptions of product features and pricing.
* Tag: product\_info
* Agent usage: When the Agent receives a question such as “How does the premium plan work?”, it retrieves the answer from Product\_Manual.pdf using the product\_info tag.<br>

**Example 2 – URL**

* URL: https://www.example.com/faq – contains the company’s Frequently Asked Questions page.
* Tag: faq
* Agent usage: When a user asks “What are the refund conditions?”, the Agent searches the content of the linked FAQ page (tagged as faq) and provides the correct answer.

#### 💡 Best Practices

* Use clear and descriptive filenames, e.g. User\_Guide\_2025.pdf instead of document1.pdf.
* Assign specific tags for each topic or category (e.g. pricing, support, technical\_specs).
* Avoid using the same tag for unrelated content.
* When updating a document, replace it instead of uploading a new file to keep the knowledge base organized.
* Periodically refresh URLs to ensure the Agent always uses the most up-to-date information.
