# AI Knowledge Hub

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way businesses interact with customers, automate processes, and generate content. At indigo.ai, we empower businesses with cutting-edge AI solutions, leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), Conversational AI, Generative AI, and Large Language Models (LLMs).

This **AI Knowledge Hub** serves as a central guide for understanding these core AI concepts and how they power the indigo.ai platform. Below, you’ll find a series of articles that provide both introductory and deep-dive insights into these technologies.
