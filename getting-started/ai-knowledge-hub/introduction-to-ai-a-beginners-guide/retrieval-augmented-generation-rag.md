# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to **combine the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with external, up-to-date information from knowledge bases or databases**.&#x20;

While LLMs alone might be limited by the data they were trained on—especially if it’s not current or specific enough—RAG allows the model to produce more accurate, relevant, and context-aware responses in real-time.

## How Does It Work?

1. **User Query**
   1. A user provides a query or request (e.g., “What is the capital of \[X]?” or “Explain \[topic] in simple terms.”).
2. **Retrieval Step**
   1. The system searches a knowledge base (which could be documents, FAQs, websites, or any structured/unstructured data source) for relevant information.
   2. This often involves using vector embeddings: the query is converted into an embedding and compared against embeddings of stored documents to find the most relevant matches.
3. **Augmentation (Context Construction)**
   1. The retrieved information is then bundled together with the user’s query to form an augmented prompt or context.
4. **Generation with LLM**
   1. The LLM takes the augmented prompt (query + retrieved context) and generates a response.
   2. Because the model has direct access to the retrieved information, it can give answers that are more accurate and grounded in the current data.
5. **Response Delivery**
   1. The system presents the final answer to the user, often with references or citations back to the source documents.

## **Why It’s Helpful**

* **Accuracy & Up-to-Date Info**: The LLM no longer relies solely on its internal training data. It can incorporate fresh data, making answers more reliable.
* **Explainability**: By tracing the retrieved documents, the system can show sources, increasing transparency.
* **Flexibility**: You can point the retrieval step at any domain or dataset, enabling domain-specific or real-time solutions.

At indigo.ai, we’ve built a **cutting-edge RAG pipeline** that seamlessly integrates external knowledge sources into every conversational interaction. By **combining advanced retrieval methods and generative modeling**, our system ensures that user queries are always answered with the most relevant, up-to-date information. This robust design not only boosts accuracy and reliability but also provides clear references and sources, making our Conversational Assistants truly dynamic and trustworthy.
