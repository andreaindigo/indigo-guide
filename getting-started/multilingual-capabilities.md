# Multilingual Capabilities

indigo.ai supports powerful multilingual capabilities to help you **engage users in their preferred language,** without any extra setup. Whether you're building a single-language virtual assistant or need advanced control over multiple languages, here's how our platform handles multilingual conversations.

## üåè Multilingual by Design

Our AI Agents are **multilingual by design**. Powered by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), they can:

* **Automatically detect the language** your user is speaking
* **Understand and respond** in that same language
* **Support over 120 languages**, out of the box.

{% hint style="info" %}
We‚Äôre working on bringing full multilingual management directly into the platform, allowing you to configure and manage multiple languages from your workspace UI. This feature is expected to launch in 2025.
{% endhint %}

While the AI Agent can understand and reply in multiple languages, **some static elements are not multilingual unless specifically configured**. These include:

* The **Welcome Message**
* Interface text in the **Web Chat widget**
* Static content created using **Text Blocks** in workflows.&#x20;

To make these elements dynamic for an extra language, you will need a custom add-on.

## üåê Adding an Extra Language (Add-on)

We offer an **advanced multilingual add-on** for clients who want greater control over user experience in each supported language.

With this add-on, you can:

* **Customize static messages** (e.g., welcome messages, quick replies) based on the user‚Äôs detected language
* **Adapt tone, phrasing, and content** to match the local culture or your brand‚Äôs voice in each language
* **Ensure a consistent multilingual experience** from the moment the assistant loads, including the chat widget bubble, first message, and full interface.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
**üÜï Streamlined Multilingual Management**

In June 2025, we released a powerful new feature that simplifies the management of multilingual assistants. It offers **greater control** and an **easier setup** for automatically translating static content and widget interface elements, helping you deliver a seamless experience in every supported language.

#### Example: Personalized Welcome Messages

Once the multilingual add-on is enabled, your virtual assistant can:

* Automatically detect the user‚Äôs language
* Display a customized welcome message and other static content in that language
* Maintain language consistency throughout the entire conversation.

{% hint style="info" %}
Activating this option incurs an extra cost for each additional language. [Contact us](../need-help/our-customer-success-team.md) to enable this for your virtual assistant.&#x20;
