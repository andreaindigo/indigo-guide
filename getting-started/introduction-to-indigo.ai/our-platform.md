## 🖥️ Workspaces

Our platform is built around **Workspaces**—dedicated digital environments where you build and manage your AI-powered workforce.&#x20;

Each Workspace represents a **specific virtual assistant**, designed for a particular use case within a single communication channel.

This structure allows you to run multiple projects simultaneously:

* A web chat and the same virtual assistant deployed via voice would each have separate workspaces, as they operate on different channels.
* Two virtual assistants with different functions—like customer support and internal HR assistance—would also be organized into distinct workspaces.

With Workspaces, you can efficiently manage your AI Agents while keeping tasks and workflows organized by project and channel.

## Workspace Structure

Every workspace is accessible from any browser and consists of several key areas. Below is an overview of each section, listed from top to bottom as they appear in the left-side menu:&#x20;

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-03-24 alle 14.42.12.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The indigo.ai Workspace</p></figcaption></figure>

### 🏡 Home

The Home section serves as the landing page whenever you open a specific workspace. It provides a daily snapshot of essential metrics for monitoring your agents performance: number of users interacting with your agents, total chat sessions initiated and messages handled by your virtual assistant.&#x20;

### 💬 Chats

In the Chats section, you can explore all conversations the virtual assistant has had with users. Key features include:

* **Filtering and Searching**: Easily find specific conversations or messages.
* **Human Takeover**: Join live chats and communicate directly with users, pausing the agent's responses.
* **Debugging Insights**: View detailed debugging information for each agent reply, helping you understand its reasoning—especially useful during testing.

> _For more information, check out our detailed guide here:_ [chats](../workspace-sections/chats/ "mention")_._&#x20;

### 📄 Docs & URLs

The Docs & URLs section allows you to upload documents and links to enrich your knowledge base—a fundamental part of your virtual assistant's functionality. Key capabilities include:

* **Content Upload**: Add documents and URLs to provide your AI agents with relevant knowledge.
* **Documents Tagging**: Assign tags to categorize documents by topic. The tags will be used to link each agent to a specific topic, ensuring they only search content relevant to their tasks.

> _In this article, you'll find detailed information about this functionality, along with step-by-step instructions and best practices for creating and uploading your knowledge base:_ [create-your-knowledge-base](../../build-your-ai-agents/create-your-knowledge-base/ "mention")_._&#x20;

### 📊 Analytics

The Analytics section provides comprehensive metrics to evaluate your virtual assistant's performance over specific time frames. These include basic metrics, such as total number of chats and unique users, and detailed insights like user satisfaction ratings, button clicks, and other engagement indicators.

> _Learn more about our built-in Analytics and how to gain valuable insights into your agents' performance and user behavior here:_ [analytics.md](../workspace-sections/analytics.md "mention")_._

### 📏Utilities

The Utilities section gives you access to advanced tools that help you analyze, evaluate, and optimize your virtual assistant. It is designed for teams who need deeper insights into conversations and effective ways to improve performance.

> _Learn more about Conversation Logs, Evaluators and Guardrails and Issue Tracker here:_ [utilities](../workspace-sections/utilities/ "mention")_._

### ⚙️ Configuration Area

Below the primary sections, the Configuration Area is where you build and manage your AI agents. This space is divided into two environments:

* **Draft** Area: Work in progress—agents and workflows created here are inactive.
* **Live** Area: Active agents and workflows powering your virtual assistant.

To create agents and workflows, click the + button and organize them into folders. Selecting an agent or workflow—such as the General Agent—opens its configuration page, and building blocks appear on the right side.

To test and deploy your virtual assistant, use the buttons in the top-right corner:

* **Preview**: Test the agents live based on your configurations and automatically saved changes.
* **Publish**: Deploy the virtual assistant and make it available to users.

> * _Get practical, hands-on guidance for building your digital agents independently (applying the concepts covered in the articles above) here:_ [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")_._

### 🤖 Agents Settings

This section allows you to centrally manage settings for all agents, including for example creativity levels, LLM model preferences, and more.

> _For more information, check out our detailed guide here:_ [how-to-create-an-agent.md](../agents-workflows-and-triggers/how-to-create-an-agent.md "mention").

### 🧩 Variables

The Variables section provides centralized control of all variables used by your agents. These variables help create dynamic conversational flows and connect to external data sources via APIs.

> _This article provides an in-depth explanation of variables and how to use them effectively:_ [variables](../blocks-and-variables/variables/ "mention")_._

### 🛠️ Settings & Installations

The Settings & Installations section allows you to customize the web chat widget, manage workspace access and user roles, access workspace information and virtual assistant installation details, and more.&#x20;
