# Logic Blocks

Logic Blocks are essential tools for shaping the behavior of your virtual assistant and designing conversations that are dynamic, context-aware, and personalized. While Action Blocks focus on _doing_ (e.g., sending emails or uploading files), **Logic Blocks help your assistant&#x20;**_**decide**_**&#x20;and&#x20;**_**respond**_**&#x20;intelligently based on user input, external data, or internal conditions**.

They allow you to:

* **Guide the conversation path**
* **React intelligently to what the user says**
* **Process and store structured information**
* **Personalize responses in real time**.&#x20;

Below are the Logic Blocks available in the indigo.ai platform. Click on each block name to explore its full functionality and learn how to use it effectively in your workflows:

* [🔀 **Reroute Block**](reroute-block.md)\
  Redirects the conversation to a different agent or workflow. Use it to create flexible flows that adapt to user needs, routing conversations logically and seamlessly across your assistant structure.
* [🔣 **Condition Block**](condition-block.md)\
  Evaluates conditions based on variables and logic. This block enables the assistant to make decisions (e.g., “If the user is over 18, show this path”) and dynamically tailor the flow to real-time inputs.
* [🗃️ **Capture Block**](capture-block.md)\
  Used to ask questions and collect user input, which is then stored in variables. Whether it’s a name, date, number, or yes/no response, this block helps you gather and reuse information throughout the conversation.
* [🔧 **Set Values Block**](set-values-block.md)\
  Allows you to manually assign or reset the value of a variable. It’s great for managing logic, initializing variables at the start of the conversation, or updating data based on user actions.
* [**🧪 Collect Block**](collect-block.md)\
  Extracts and collects structured data directly from natural user input. This block intelligently identifies relevant values, saves them to variables, and optionally prompts the user for missing information. It’s ideal for gathering multiple data points (e.g., email, product type, order ID) without building rigid, linear flows.
