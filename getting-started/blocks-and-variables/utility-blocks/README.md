# Utility Blocks

Utility Blocks provide **support functions** that elevate your assistant‚Äôs capabilities behind the scenes.

While some blocks directly shape the conversation your users see and hear, others work silently in the background to supp**ort, organize, and extend your a**ssistant‚Äôs behavior.

These blocks don‚Äôt always produce visible output in the chat, but they are essential for:

* Enabling advanced logic and system integrations
* Keeping workflows clear, organized, and easy to manage
* Enhancing collaboration across your team
* Powering non-conversational use cases, especially in [Voice channels](../../communication-channels/voice.md)

Below are the Utility Blocks available on the indigo.ai platform. Click on each block name to learn more about how it works and how to use it in your assistant workflows:

* [üß† **Prompt Block**](prompt-block.md)\
  Generates advanced natural-language outputs or **structured data (like JSON)** using Large Language Models (LLMs). Ideal for **classification tasks**, **text extraction**, or enriching your assistant‚Äôs logic with dynamic AI-powered outputs.
* [üóíÔ∏è **Notes Block**](notes-block.md)\
  A non-executable block used to **add internal documentation** and reminders within workflows. Notes help your team stay aligned and your flows stay well-organized.
* [**üßæ Metadata Block**](metadata-block.md)\
  Allows you to inject **structured JSON metadata** into your workflow, especially for **Voice assistants**.
