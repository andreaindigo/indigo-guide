# 🗒️ Notes Block

The Notes Block is a simple yet essential tool designed to enhance organization, communication, and collaboration within your workspace. While it doesn’t interact with end users or influence the flow of conversation, it plays a crucial role in documenting internal logic and keeping your team aligned.

The Notes Block can be inserted at any point in your workflow and is **used exclusively for internal documentation**. It allows you to **add brief comments or reminders directly within your conversation flow**.

Notes are not visible to end users. They are purely for internal use and will not appear in the chat interface.

## How It Works

Use the Notes Block to:

* **Provide context** around specific parts of the flow
* **Leave reminders** for future updates or maintenance
* **Communicate with collaborators**

✅ **Best Practice**: Place notes **close to relevant blocks** so they’re easy to spot and interpret when editing or reviewing the workflow later.

## Common Use Cases

#### 👥 Team Collaboration

When multiple people are working on the same assistant, Notes help everyone stay aligned by documenting key decisions, open tasks, or important clarifications.

#### 🔄 Tracking Changes

Use Notes to record recent or upcoming changes—such as adjustments to API blocks, logic tweaks, or updates to third-party integrations (e.g., Google Sheets).

#### 📚 Workflow Documentation

For complex flows, Notes can explain **why** a particular structure was chosen or what logic is being applied, making it easier for others (or your future self) to understand and maintain the assistant.
