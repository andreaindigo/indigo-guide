# Action Blocks

Action Blocks enhance your virtual assistant by enabling it to **perform specific actions within the conversation flow**. Whether it’s sending an email, offering predefined response options, sharing documents, transferring the chat to a human operator, or connecting to external systems, action blocks make it possible to design smarter, more interactive conversations.

These blocks are essential when you want your assistant or your users to do something, not just say something. Each block performs a different type of action and can be added at any point in your workflow to match your logic and goals.

Below are the five types of Action Blocks available in the platform:

* [🔗 **Mail**](mail-block.md)\
  Automatically send personalized emails from your workflow—perfect for sharing conversation summaries, sending confirmations, forwarding user requests, or notifying internal teams.
* [👉 **Quick Reply**](handover-block.md)\
  Presents clickable options to users, guiding them through the conversation with structured choices instead of free text input.
* [🤝 **Handover**](handover-block.md)\
  Seamlessly transfers the conversation to a human operator when a request requires personal attention or can't be handled by the AI.
* [📎 **Upload**](upload-block.md)\
  Enables users and human operators to upload files (documents, images, PDFs) during the chat—perfect for customer support or application processes.
* [**🌐 API Block**](api-block.md)\
  Connects your assistant to external systems by making real-time API calls. You can retrieve or send data from/to CRMs, databases, or other tools—enabling your assistant to take actions based on live business data.
* [**Hang up Block**](hang-up-block.md)\
  Terminates a voice call and optionally triggers a post-call workflow.
* [**Transfer call Block**](transfer-call-block.md)\
  Transfers a voice call to an external number with waiting and fallback management.
