# ü§ù Handover Block

Efficiently **handle sensitive requests** by **transferring the conversation to a human operator** when needed. The Handover feature ensures a seamless transition from automated responses to human assistance, enhancing customer satisfaction and overall service quality.

The Handover Block is designed to manage requests that require further support beyond the capabilities of the virtual assistant. It enables a smooth handoff from the AI agent to a human operator, who can directly take over the conversation through the dedicated functionality in the chat section of our platform.&#x20;

### Quick Replies and Workflow Integration

In cases where no operator is available, or the support center is closed, you can integrate [**Quick Replies**](quick-reply-block.md) into the Handover Block. This allows you to connect the user‚Äôs reply to another workflow or agent, such as collecting user details (e.g., name, email, phone number) to be contacted later by the support team.

### Notifications and Alerts

The Notification button in the Handover Block opens a dropdown menu where you can add email addresses that will receive notifications whenever the block is activated. Operators will be notified via a **sound alert in the browser tab** and **receive an email** with a call-to-action that takes them directly to the chat needing assistance.
