# Hang up Block

The Hang up block allows you to end a voice call at specific points in the flow. It is available among the Action blocks and works only in voice workflows (it is skipped in text chats and web calls).

You can add **multiple Hang up blocks** in the same workflow, but only the first one executed will actually close the call and, if configured, trigger a post-call workflow.

\
Additionally, the block can be set to start a workflow right after the call ends, enabling follow-up actions such as call classification, API requests, or sending emails.

### Hang up Block â€“ Functional Requirements

* **Placement**: The block can be used at any point in a workflow and can appear multiple times. However, the call will end as soon as the block is executed the first time.
* **Call termination**: When executed, the block immediately closes the voice call.
* **Post-call actions**:
  * If no destination workflow is selected, the call simply ends.
  * If a destination workflow is selected, it starts right after the call ends. In this case, the block internally performs a reroute to the chosen workflow.
* **Deleted workflows**: If the destination workflow linked to a Hang up block is deleted, it will no longer appear as a selectable option.



**Important note on multiple Hang up blocks**

The reroute action linked to a Hang up block can only happen if the call is still active when the block is executed.

This means that:

* If you add more than one Hang up block in the same workflow, only the first one will actually close the call and (optionally) trigger a post-call workflow.
* If the post-call workflow started by a Hang up block also contains another Hang up, that second block wonâ€™t do anythingâ€”because the call has already ended.\


ðŸ’¡ **In short**: once the call is closed, itâ€™s not possible to trigger new flows with other Hangup blocks. Each Hangup can be used only once to end the call and optionally start a post-call workflow.
