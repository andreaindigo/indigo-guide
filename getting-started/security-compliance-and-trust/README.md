## 2. AI Act Compliance: What You Need to Know

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/EU_AI_Act_logo_main.png" alt="" width="188"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The [**AI Act**](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/), adopted in 2024, introduces a regulatory framework for the development and use of AI systems within the European Union.&#x20;

While indigo.ai is **not classified as a provider of high-risk AI**, our platform and features are designed to meet and exceed the AI Act‚Äôs core principles of **transparency, human oversight, and data protection**.

### Our Approach

* **Transparency**: We ensure that users are always informed when they are interacting with an AI system, as required under Article 50 of the AI Act.
* **No Manipulation**: We do not‚Äîand do not allow‚Äîany use of AI for deceptive, manipulative, or exploitative purposes, as prohibited under Article 5 of the AI Act. One example of this commitment is our **state-of-the-art** [**Anti-Jailbreak Detection Tool**](anti-jailbreak-detection-tool.md), which is designed to prevent users from attempting to bypass safety measures or manipulate AI responses.
* **Human Oversight**: Our platform is designed to allow easy human intervention and control over AI-driven processes.
* **Data Protection**: Tools like [audit logs](audit-logs-full-transparency-for-your-security-operations.md), [secrets management](secrets-management-protecting-your-sensitive-information.md), and [access controls](single-sign-on-sso-and-multi-factor-authentication-mfa.md) help you comply with GDPR and internal policies.

### Your Responsibilities as a Deployer

As a deployer of AI systems, you have specific responsibilities under the AI Act. Here's how to stay compliant:

**1. Disclose AI Use to End Users**

Under **Article 50**, you must clearly inform users that they are interacting with an AI system. This is particularly important in cases where the interaction might not be obviously AI-driven:

* Add a [**welcome message**](https://indigo-ai.gitbook.io/indigo.ai-guide/build-your-ai-agents/configure-your-ai-agents#configuring-a-welcome-message) such as: ‚ÄúHi! I‚Äôm your virtual assistant powered by AI.‚Äù
* In **voice channels**, this must be stated at the beginning of a call‚Äînot just on the website or interface‚Äã.

**2. Avoid Prohibited Use Cases**

Do **not** use indigo.ai to implement AI agents that:

* Exploit vulnerabilities of users due to age, disability, or economic status.
* Deceive or manipulate users' decisions.
* Perform real-time biometric identification, profiling, or risk prediction based on personality traits. These practices are explicitly banned under **Article 5** of the AI Act‚Äã.

**3. Ensure AI Literacy and Oversight**

Article 4 and Article 26 assign responsibilities to **deployers**:

* Ensure your team members using indigo.ai are appropriately trained and understand how AI systems function.
* Apply human oversight in workflows where sensitive decisions or data processing are involved.

## 3. Security Features
