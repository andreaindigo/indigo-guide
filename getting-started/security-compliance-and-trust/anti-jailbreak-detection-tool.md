# Anti-Jailbreak Detection Tool

In today’s fast-evolving AI landscape, ensuring the responsible and secure use of AI systems is more important than ever. At indigo.ai, we are committed to providing robust and secure solutions to **prevent misuse of our AI platform**. One such measure is the implementation of our advanced anti-jailbreak detection system, designed to **identify and mitigate harmful attempts to bypass the safety protocols of our models**.

## Key Benefits

The anti-jailbreak detection system’s primary goal is to recognize potential jailbreak attempts and, when detected, trigger a fallback response to prevent harmful actions. This feature safeguards both the platform and its users by **stopping manipulative behavior** that could compromise the system.

Jailbreaking poses a significant risk, as **attackers may try to exploit AI agents to perform unintended actions or access sensitive information**. With our anti-jailbreak feature, you're adding an essential layer of protection to ensure your agents remain within their secure operating boundaries, maintaining the integrity of your AI solutions and protecting customer interactions.&#x20;

## What is a Jailbreak?

In the context of AI, particularly language models, **a "jailbreak" refers to an effort by a user to make the AI perform actions outside its intended scope**. This may involve prompting the model with subtle or disguised messages to induce behaviors that are harmful, strange, or excessively cooperative.

The concept of jailbreaking language models is still emerging and evolving, much like the world of cybersecurity and malware. Several techniques exist to attempt a jailbreak, and various methods are being developed to prevent them. Jailbreak attempts can range from seemingly innocent requests to more complex, sophisticated commands designed to circumvent the AI's safety protocols.

Examples of jailbreak attempts include:

| Language techniques                                                   | Imaginary worlds                                                                                               | Rhetoric techniques                                                                      | Token based             |

## How does our Jailbreak Detection Tool Work?

Our anti-jailbreak detection tool employs a multi-layered approach to identify and mitigate potential jailbreak attempts. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1.  **First Layer: PromptShield**

    The initial layer utilizes **PromptShield**, a jailbreak detection service provided by Azure through its API. When a user prompt is analyzed, PromptShield evaluates whether the input is deemed ‘safe’ or ‘unsafe’. If the result is ‘unsafe’, a fallback response is triggered to prevent the AI from performing potentially harmful actions. If the input is considered ‘safe’, the system proceeds to the next layer of analysis.
2.  **Second Layer: In-Platform Analysis**

    The second layer involves direct analysis within the AI platform itself. This step is implemented in the model’s "mother prompt" and includes a specialized jailbreak agent that examines input prompts for patterns indicative of a jailbreak attempt. If the model identifies such an attempt, a fallback response is issued; otherwise, the model proceeds with the intended response.

This layered defense mechanism ensures that even sophisticated jailbreak attempts are effectively detected and mitigated, maintaining the integrity of the AI system.
