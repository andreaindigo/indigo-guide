# Create Your Knowledge Base

## Why a Well-Structured Knowledge Base is Essential

AI Agents rely on **accurate, well-organized knowledge** to function effectively. A Knowledge Base (KB) serves as their foundation, ensuring responses are precise, relevant, and aligned with business goals. Without a structured KB, AI-driven interactions risk becoming inconsistent, inefficient, or even misleading.

Benefits of a well-structured KB:&#x20;

* ✅ **Always Up-to-Date -** AI Agents always consult the latest information before responding.
* **🔍 Accurate & Contextual** - Ensures precise and relevant answers, reducing misinformation.
* **🚀 Reduces Human Effort** - Minimizes reliance on manual support by enabling users self-service.
* **🎯 Centralized Information Hub** - Ensures consistency across all interactions.

A well-maintained KB is especially crucial for customer support, where quick and accurate responses improve user experience and reduce the workload for human agents.

A Knowledge Base can include a variety of documentation, such as Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), step-by-step process guides, product specifications, spreadsheets with services and product data, etc.

A well-structured KB transforms AI interactions from simple automated replies into intelligent, dynamic conversations.&#x20;

## Structuring Your KB for Optimal AI Performance

A Knowledge Base is more than just a collection of documents, it needs to be **carefully** **structured** for AI-driven retrieval.

To enhance searchability and retrieval accuracy, your Knowledge Base (KB) should be **organized into topics / referred to as tags** in the indigo.ai platform. 🏷️

These **tags are assigned to AI Agents during configuration**, ensuring that each agent accesses **only the information relevant** to its function.

{% hint style="info" %}
💡 Tip: Instead of one massive document, divide content into multiple, specific files with distinct tags.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

A poorly structured KB can lead to slow responses, higher AI errors, and a frustrating user experience. By optimizing the KB structure, you can ensure smooth, efficient, and accurate AI interactions.

## How indigo.ai's AI Agents Retrieve Information

At indigo.ai, we use cutting-edge RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology, which enables AI Agents to dynamically fetch, process, and generate real-time responses from your knowledge sources.

This method allows our AI Agents to:

* Retrieve relevant information on-demand instead of relying solely on pre-trained data.
* Generate real-time, context-aware responses.&#x20;
* Minimize misinformation by cross-referencing multiple sources before delivering an answer.

{% hint style="info" %}

## Two Ways to Upload Your KB

indigo.ai offers **two primary methods** for integrating your Knowledge Base into AI Agents:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/For KB.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### 1. 📄 **Static Document Uploads**&#x20;

This method allows you to **upload files such as PDFs, DOCs, spreadsheets, and even web pages (URLs)** directly into your Knowledge Base. It's an ideal solution for storing and managing fixed information like FAQs, company policies, and product manuals.

**Key benefits:**\
✅ Quick and easy setup, no technical integration required.\
✅ Best suited for structured, stable content that doesn’t change frequently.

**Considerations:**\
🔄 Requires manual updates whenever information changes.

#### 📢  Need to Upload a Large Volume of Documents? We've Got You Covered!

If your documentation is already stored in platforms like **Google Drive, Microsoft SharePoint, Confluence, or CRM/ERP systems**, manually uploading each document might not be efficient.

**Our team can help** streamline large-scale KB uploads by:

* **Connecting** directly to your data sources and syncing information efficiently.
* **Reorganizing and structuring** content for optimal AI processing.
* **Automating document ingestion**, saving you time and effort.

We’ll ensure your Knowledge Base is seamlessly integrated with your AI Agents for the best possible performance.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### 2. 🔗 **API-Based Integration with Your System**&#x20;

For businesses that require **real-time, dynamic data access**, API-based integration allows AI Agents to directly retrieve up-to-date information from your internal systems, such as:

* **Databases** (e.g., customer records, transaction history)
* **CMS platforms** (e.g., product descriptions, blog content)
* **E-commerce catalogs** (e.g., pricing, stock availability)
* **CRM systems** (e.g. history of client support requests).&#x20;

**Why Choose API Integration?**

✅ **Always up to date:** AI Agents fetch live data, eliminating the need for manual updates.\
✅ **Enhanced accuracy:** Ensures responses are based on the latest available information.\
✅ **Seamless automation:** AI can interact with real-time sources to provide dynamic answers.\
✅ **Best for Large and Complex Datasets:** Ideal for managing extensive and structured information efficiently.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Even if your content does not change frequently, API integration may still be the **best choice** when handling **large, structured, or complex datasets**. Here’s why:

* **Product catalogs should always be integrated via API** (e.g., Google Sheets, Shopify) rather than as static documents to ensure better searchability and retrieval efficiency.
* **Complex, high-volume content** is easier to manage via integration rather than static uploaded documents.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Considerations**

🛠 **Requires technical setup:** Initial configuration and API connections must be established.\
🔄 **Ongoing maintenance:** Regular updates and monitoring ensure smooth operation.

## Choosing the Right KB Setup for Your Needs

The best Knowledge Base setup depends on **how often your content changes** and the **complexity of your data**.

* **Use API integration** for frequently updated content (e.g., product catalogs, order tracking, real-time inventory) or **large, structured datasets** that require efficient search and retrieval (e.g., extensive e-commerce catalogs, CRM databases).
* **Use document uploads** for static, low-maintenance content, such as company policies, FAQs, or customer service guidelines.
* **Combine both methods** for flexibility: upload documents for foundational content like company policies while integrating APIs for real-time or complex data access.

In the upcoming articles, you will find a detailed guide on both solutions, covering their setup process and best practices.&#x20;

## Assess the Effort Needed to Build Your KB

In the next article, you'll find a **practical checklist** designed to help you:

* ✅ **Identify potential challenges** before starting to configure your AI Agents.
* ✅ **Streamline the process** by planning and optimizing your KB creation upfront.
* ✅ **Reduce project complexity and timeline** with a structured, step-by-step approach.

This guide ensures you have a **clear roadmap** for building an AI-ready Knowledge Base efficiently. 🚀
